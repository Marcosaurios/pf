# Custom portfolio theme for WordPress CMS
I modified my static website to work with Wordpress.\
You can use it by cloning it in **/wp-content/themes/** folder, 
where you have installed and deployed your WordPress site. To use it, once copied there you will only 
need to enable **pf** theme in **_Appearance_**  tab in the WordPress admin menu dashboard.\
There are 4 kind of _posts_ when you load the theme:
  1.  Posts: Adding a new post here will display at the first card that you'll find on the theme.\
  **It's limited to 1, so adding more will make no effect.** You can change the url of the media-links by editing the html itself.
  2.  Events: Here you will add a new element for the grid that's next to the card you created before.  
  The theme gets each _featured image_ displayed as thumbnail on the layout. If you insert a gallery in the description, you'll generate
  a mobile-responsive gallery.
  3.  Videos: By writing the link of the video, and setting a _featured image_, you'll have this image in parallax with a thumbnail of the video centered.
  4.  Main img: And the last one gets all the featured images of this _'Main img'_ posts and shows it at the top of the web, in a carousel.
  
Finally, the menu can be modified by editing the html #tags in the code. 
It's built with a sweet smooth-scroll, and you can set them on **Appearance>Menus**.
